I've learned a lot of software engineering principles while at NCSU and I have become even more interested after knowing how much more there is to learn. I'm also working on a minor in Mathematics, and an accelerated Master's degree in Computer Science. If I'm not working on my car or researching something, I'm probably at the lake, and growing up in West Virginia, I love to ski in the winter."
